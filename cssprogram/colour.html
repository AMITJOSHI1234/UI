        <p>RRR[a] is a 2022 Indian Telugu-language epic action drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, who co-wrote the
            film with V. Vijayendra Prasad. It was produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainment. The film stars N.
            T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt, Shriya Saran, Samuthirakani, Ray Stevenson, Alison
            Doody, and Olivia Morris. RRR is an alternate history and historical fiction movie.[5][6] It centers around
            two real-life Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), their
            fictional friendship and their fight against the British Raj. Set in the 1920s, the plot explores the
            undocumented period in their lives when both the revolutionaries chose to go into obscurity before they
            began the fight for their country.

            Rajamouli came across stories about the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem and connected the coincidences between
            them, imagining what would have happened had they met, and been friends. The film was formally announced in
            March 2018. Principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad and continued until August
            2021, owing to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It was filmed extensively across India, with a few
            sequences filmed in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M.
            Keeravani, with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the
            film's production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.</p>
