        Madhya Pradesh Religious Tourism will indeed be expanded vastly with the opening of the Mahakal
        Lok corridor in Ujjain and that’s what people expect to be along with the prime minister. Ashish Kumar Pathak,
        the CEO of Ujjain Smart City has said after the opening of Mahakal Lok Corridor that it will become a major
        tourist attraction in Ujjain and annual tourist footfall is “expected to double” according to him. He quoted,
        “About 1.5 crore people visit the temple every year. And, this annual figure is expected to double to about
        three crores after the opening of the ‘Mahakal Lok.”</p>
